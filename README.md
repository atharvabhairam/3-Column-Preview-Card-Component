# 3-Column Preview Card Component

This project is a **3-Column Preview Card Component** built as part of a challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io). The component showcases three different types of vehicles: Sedans, SUVs, and Luxury cars. Each card provides a brief description of the vehicle type and a "Learn More" button. The design is responsive and visually appealing, with hover effects and modern typography.

## Features

- **3-Column Layout**: Displays three cards side by side on desktop and stacked on mobile.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Hover Effects**: Interactive hover effects on the "Learn More" buttons for better user experience.
- **Modern Typography**: Uses Google Fonts ("Lexend Deca" and "Big Shoulders Display") for clean and modern typography.
- **Color Coding**: Each card has a distinct color to differentiate between vehicle types.
